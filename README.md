# Power System Fault Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to **detect and classify different types of faults** in a power distribution system using electrical measurement data like **voltage and current phasors**

## üß† Technologies Used

- **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio** (for model development & deployment)
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage** (for dataset handling)
- **Machine Learning Models**:

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Used a publicly available dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) with labeled fault types.

2. **Data Pre-processing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Normalized and cleaned the data

3. **Model Training**  
   Trained a Random Forest Classifier to classify fault types.

4. **Model Deployment**  
   Deployed the model using IBM Watsonx.ai with a real-time API for fault prediction.

## ‚úÖ Results

The model was able to **accurately classify** fault types based on input voltage and current phasor values. It demonstrated high performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìå Conclusion

This machine learning model enables:
- Rapid and accurate detection of power system faults
- Automation of grid monitoring
- Improved decision-making and fault response time
